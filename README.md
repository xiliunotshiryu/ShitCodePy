## Preface
With the rapid development of AI technology, it is soon expected to replace many human jobs, leading to increased unemployment rates in some industries, including programmers. Recently, many large tech companies and startups have begun using AI to create virtual programmers, causing great anxiety among my friends.

Imagine a future world filled with AI-programmed formatted code, how terrifying that would be! Such nearly perfect codes all look the same, lacking the artistic touch of humanity. Humans need ShitCode. Also, if a project is full of ShitCode, it would look like a mountain of ShitCode piled up. 
AI programmers would also find it harder to understand and maintain these projects, and engineering projects that extensively use ShitCode standards will become useless samples, increasing the cost of learning and training for AI programmers. Thinking of this, I am reminded of my ShitCode coding career, which was a very arduous experience.

Thereâ€™s a saying in the ShitCode community: â€˜Writing good ShitCode requires talent and effort,â€™ and I deeply agree. Looking around at friends and colleagues, they all possess profound coding skills and good coding habits, making it very difficult for them now to write excellent ShitCode.

Therefore, I decided to create this project, hoping to spread the coding skills of ShitCode so that more friends can quickly learn how to write excellent ShitCode. Python is one of my favorite programming languages and is also one of the most widely used, so I decided to focus on Python and named it ShitCodePy.

## Project description
* This project will provide any coding standards, techniques, tools, and examples related to ShitCode in the Python language;
* Many parts of the foreword are described in a joking manner, so please donâ€™t take them seriously; if you are a Python beginner or a serious Python developer, please use this project as a negative example for learning;
* I hope that one day this project can become the ShitCode art bible for all Python developers;



Letâ€™s start the journey of ShitCodePy!
